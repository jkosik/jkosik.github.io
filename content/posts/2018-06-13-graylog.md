Many security guys have already faced a challange to deploy scalable Log Management solution in Cloud using open-source tools only. So had I and documented our approach and shared some hints for you.
In the case study published on [Graylog Blog](https://www.graylog.org/post/large-scale-log-management-deployment-with-graylog-a-customer-perspective) you can find details from the infrastructure and VM level up to the SIEM layer covering [Infrasturcture as a Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) and [CICD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD) as well.

The case study covers several lessons learned in the implementation, such as:

How to set up various environments to receive the maximum benefit for CICD purposes
How to set up load balancers for optimum performance in data replication and data flow across environments
Best practices for parsing log data
Scaling the infrastructure for maximum storage performance
How to set up log aggregation for reliable and secure data consumption
What they did to ensure zero downtime and resiliency
The best Graylog plug-ins to replicate SIEM functionality
