In this blog post, I’ll show you how I supercharged the Cursor code assistant by feeding it real-time data from remote data sources — essentially teaching it things it wasn’t pre-trained to know. Technology described offers huge range of other use cases and is a "new big thing in AI".

AI-powered code assistants like GitHub Copilot and Cursor are rapidly transforming the way we write, debug, and manage code. They’re smart, fast, and often feel like having a coding companion in your IDE. But there's a catch: most of these tools depend entirely on pre-trained models, which means they can be out of sync with your current project or the latest changes in your environment.

That’s where things get interesting. We’ll dive into Cursor — an AI-first IDE that’s at the forefront of this evolution — and explore how you can break past those limitations using something called the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Specifically, I’ll walk you through how I connected real-time data from Splunk to Cursor, making the assistant context-aware and smarter on the fly.

**Our today's goal:**

## Use cases

Picture a cybersecurity team crafting and codifying detection rules for new threats, analyzing attack patterns, and building smart alerting systems. Now imagine giving their AI assistant direct access to the organization’s live security telemetry via Splunk. Suddenly, the assistant can spot coverage gaps, review past incidents, detect overlapping controls, and even suggest better responses - all in real time.
