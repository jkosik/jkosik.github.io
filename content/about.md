## TLDR
Delivery-obsessed tech lead where DevSecOps, Engineering, AI, and Crypto intersect.

## Key principle
**Secure → Deploy → Repeat**

Passion lies in architecting user-centric resilient systems that not only work, but work smart with automation at their core and scalability baked into their DNA.

If it’s not automated, it’s tech debt in disguise.

## What I actually do
No waving with Gantt charts and disappearing. Rather touching the code, architecting and refactoring together with my team is necessary to build what makes sense and works.

Experienced in public cloud deployments, on-prem infrastructure, including air-gapped systems - on virtual machines and in containers. Using IaaC technologies of all shapes and colors and strong in CICD.
Coding (primarily in Golang). Building security infrasturcture from scratch, including coding. Securing and automating the entire software lifecycle, from IDE, through CICD, up to the deployment and operations.
